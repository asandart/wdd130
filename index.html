        <p>Hi, my name is Asanda Magubeni. I love reading books, specifically romance novels. I have read a few of Colleen Hoover's books and I have found her to be a good writer and I say that because once you read her books, you feel so out touch with reality, you are suddenly pulled into a fantasy world where you are the main character in the book you're reading. I don't know how she does that but its amazing. I also love watching soccer. I have two siblings, an older brother and a sister. I would love to have a family of my own one day. I would love to have six kids, three girls and three boys just to balance the equation.</p>
